A plugin for WordPress developers.

== Description ==

WordPress Developer Toolkit is a handy tool for WordPress Developers. This plugin gives you 6 new shortcodes for displaying your WordPress plugins that are stored in the repository.
Once you add your plugins, you will have 6 shortcodes:

* Display Plugin Description
* Display Plugin Download Count
* Display Plugin Version
* Display Plugin Average Rating
* Display Date Of Last Update
* Display Link To Plugin File

All of this is synced to your plugin on the repository on a regular basic. So when you update your plugin, your shortcodes will automatically update.

You also get a statistics page in the admin panel. The statistics page shows:

* Number Of Plugins You Have Entered
* Total Downloads Of All Plugins
* Overall Average Rating Of All Plugins
* Overall Average Downloads Per Plugin
